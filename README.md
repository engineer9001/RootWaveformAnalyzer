# RootWaveformAnalyzer
A package designed to allow one to open a number of waveform objects saved in a root file as TGraph objects and do some shape analyses among them including a UMAP projection to a 2-dimensional space. Additionally included is a script for making a dynamic time warp matrix comparing every pair of waveforms in a sample.

# Required Packages

matplotlib (3.6.2)

uproot (4.3.7)
